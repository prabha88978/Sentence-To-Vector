# Sentence-To-Vector

When we give normal text to the Neural Network, the network can't understand the text. We are converting the normal text into system understandable format i.e., Word-to-Vector and Sentence-to-Vector.

In this post, I'm focusing on Sentence-To-Vector on Telugu text.
	
Initially I have generated the Word Embeddings for telugu text.
Then, I will give the Word Embeddings to CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) at max-pooling layer it gives sentence vector	    representation as output.

Technologies Used:
	NLTK, gensim(Google), TensorFlow, numpy
